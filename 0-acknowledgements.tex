\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\textbf{YOU MUST REPLACE THE FOLLOWING TEXT WITH YOUR OWN, OR REMOVE THIS SECTION.}

If you wish to do so, you can include some Acknowledgements here. If you don't want to, just comment out the line where this file is included.

There is absolutely no need to write an Acknowledgement section, so only do so when you \emph{want} to -- it's always important to stay sincere. One reason for including an acknowledgement could be to thank your supervisor for extraordinary supervision (or any other reason you deem noteworthy). Some supervisors sacrifice a lot, e.g., are always available, meet on weekends, provide multiple rounds of corrections for theses reports, or the like (keep in mind that writing a thesis is special for you, but not for them, so they do actually not have any reason to sacrifice their private time for this!). Seeing acknowledgements in this report can feel like a nice appreciation of this voluntary effort. For large works that form the end of some studies (like an Honours or Master thesis), it is also not uncommon to read acknowledgements to one's parents or partner. But again, completely optional!

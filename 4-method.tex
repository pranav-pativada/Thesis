\chapter{The KryBall Optimisation Algorithm}
\label{chap:method}

In this chapter, we present the KryBall optimisation algorithm. We first present the components of the algorithm, including the Krylov subspace construction, the SFN computation, and integration with the trust-region framework. We then discuss the hybrid approach used in KryBall.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Dylan Campbell, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Dylan was always available to answer my questions and provide constructive feedback on my work. His feedback was very helpful and his directions urged me to improve my skills and think deeply about my research. I am truly grateful for his continued support. 

I would also like to thank my second supervisor, Dr. João Henriques, for his valuable insights and suggestions. João's expertise in optimisation and his breakdown of complex concepts was extremely helpful in developing my understanding of core concepts.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support and encouragement. To Evan Markou, Sam Bahrami, and Mingda Xu, thank you for the fun discussions and keeping me company nearby the office. To my parents, thank you for your love and support.
